# Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist ensures the Step Challenge App is properly configured and ready for production deployment.

## Security ✅

- [x] **Helmet.js Security Headers**: XSS protection, content security policy, and other security headers configured

- [x] **Email Service Errors**: Fallback when email service is unavailable

## Documentation ✅

- [x] **Deployment Guide**: Comprehensive DEPLOYMENT.md
- [x] **Environment Variables**: All variables documented
- [x] **API Documentation**: Endpoints documented in code comments
- [x] **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Generate secure SESSION_SECRET (64+ characters)
- [ ] Configure Mailgun API key and domain
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables

### Database
- [ ] Database initializes properly
- [ ] Admin users are created
- [ ] Sample teams are created
- [ ] Data persists between restarts

### Authentication
- [ ] Magic link emails send successfully
- [ ] Login flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Sessions persist properly
- [ ] Admin authentication works
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Health check returns 200 status
- [ ] User endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Admin endpoints require admin privileges
- [ ] Data validation works properly
- [ ] Error responses are consistent

### Security
- [ ] Security headers present in responses
- [ ] HTTPS redirects work (in production)
- [ ] Cookies are secure in production
- [ ] Admin routes properly protected
- [ ] Rate limits prevent abuse

### Performance
- [ ] Response times under 300ms for API calls
- [ ] Static files serve quickly
- [ ] Database queries perform well
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable

### Deployment
- [ ] Docker container builds successfully
- [ ] Container runs as non-root user
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works
- [ ] Volume mounts work correctly

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to production:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.fly.dev/health

# Security headers check
curl -I https://your-app.fly.dev/

# Authentication flow
curl -X POST https://your-app.fly.dev/auth/send-link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@yourcompany.com"}'

# API rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -s https://your-app.fly.dev/api/leaderboard; done
```

## Monitoring Setup

Set up monitoring for:
- [ ] Response time metrics
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Database performance
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage
- [ ] Volume disk usage
- [ ] SSL certificate expiration

## Backup Strategy

Ensure:
- [ ] Volume snapshots scheduled
- [ ] Database exports automated
- [ ] User data export capability
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

## Production Launch

Final steps:
- [ ] All items in this checklist completed ✅
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] Team trained on deployment procedures
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
