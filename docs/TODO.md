## 🔄 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (Before Scaling to 150+ Users)

### Database & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Database Backup Strategy** - Implement automated backups (no backup system currently)
- [ ] **Global Error Handlers** - Add global error handlers to prevent silent crashes
- [ ] **External Uptime Monitoring** - Set up external monitoring for production alerts
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Monitor database size and implement backup rotation

### Application Deployment
- [ ] **Deploy Latest Changes to Production** - Run `fly deploy` to deploy CI/CD fixes and new logout endpoints to Fly.io
- [ ] **Production Validation** - Test new endpoints and functionality after deployment
- [ ] **Deployment Automation** - Consider automated deployment pipeline after successful CI/CD runs

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] **Token Hashing at Rest** - Security enhancement for large-scale deployment
- [ ] **Automated Token Rotation** - Advanced security feature for enterprise use
- [ ] **Region Migration Consideration** - Evaluate migrating from ORD to Singapore (sin) for global latency

### Architecture Decisions & Design Notes
- **+1 Day Timezone Allowance** - Keeping the current +1 day flexibility for future date validation. This accommodates global users in timezones ahead of Pacific Time (server timezone) and prevents DST edge cases. Removing this would break legitimate use cases for international remote workers (e.g., Asian employees trying to log steps for their "today" when server is still on "yesterday"). The current implementation balances security (prevents unlimited future dates) with user experience (allows reasonable timezone flexibility).
