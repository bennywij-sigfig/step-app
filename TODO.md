## üöß IN PROGRESS - RANKED/UNRANKED LEADERBOARD SYSTEM (July 28, 2025)

### Current Status: Partially Implemented
- [x] **Individual Leaderboards** - ‚úÖ WORKING: Ranked/unranked sections with personal reporting rates
- [ ] **Team Leaderboards** - ‚ö†Ô∏è BROKEN: Need per-team participation rate calculations
- [x] **Backend API** - Challenge-aware endpoints with Pacific Time calculations (fixed timezone bugs)
- [x] **Frontend Display** - Updated UI to show ranked/unranked sections properly
- [x] **Database Schema** - Added reporting thresholds, challenge_id columns, performance indexes

### Remaining Work Before Deploy:
1. **Fix team leaderboard calculations** - Implement proper per-team reporting rates
2. **Local testing** - Comprehensive testing of both individual and team leaderboards
3. **Database backup** - Create production backup before deployment
4. **Commit and deploy** - Push changes to production

### Implementation Notes:
- Fixed critical timezone bug (`utcToZonedTime` ‚Üí `toZonedTime`)  
- Added 70% threshold for testing (configurable per challenge)
- Pacific Time calculations working for challenge day tracking
- Individual participants now properly separated into ranked (‚â•threshold) vs unranked (<threshold)
- Frontend displays both sections with visual distinction and reporting percentages

### COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION ‚úÖ:
- [x] Fix team participation rate calculation logic - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove ecosystem check from team leaderboards - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- [x] Admin team leaderboard consistency fixes - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] UI beautification (remove emoji clutter) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add admin threshold controls (70% default, editable) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Prevent future date step entries (+1 day timezone buffer) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Next Session TODO (READY FOR DEPLOYMENT): 
- [ ] **Test all changes locally** - Team leaderboards, admin controls, future date prevention
- [ ] **Create production backup** (CRITICAL - before any deployment)
- [ ] **Git commit and push to remote** - All session changes ready for production
- [ ] **Deploy to Fly.io** (`fly deploy`) - Test on production server
- [ ] Consider consolidating calculateIndividualReportingPercentage & calculateTeamReportingPercentage functions (currently redundant - both measure individual entries vs expected, just different populations)
