## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### URGENT - Data Safety (CRITICAL - Before Scale)
1. **Create manual backup** → Backup production database immediately (15 minutes)
2. **Pre-deployment backup script** → Automated backup before deployments (30 minutes)
3. **Automated backup system** → Daily/weekly backups with retention policy (2 hours)

### Critical Stability (Required Before 150+ Users)
4. **Add global error handlers** → Prevent silent server crashes (1 hour)
5. **Add database reconnection** → Handle connection losses (2 hours)
6. **Add uptime monitoring** → External monitoring for production alerts (30 minutes)

### High-Priority User Experience (Next Feature Sprint)
7. **Add logout functionality** → User dashboard & admin panel (1 hour)
8. **Fix threshold display** → Show correct percentage in leaderboard headers (30 minutes)
9. **User profile editing** → Allow name updates (2-3 hours)
10. **Bulk user import (CSV)** → Mass onboarding for 150+ employees (3-4 hours)

### Technical Debt (Post-Launch)
11. **Consolidate reporting functions** → Merge redundant calculateIndividualReportingPercentage & calculateTeamReportingPercentage (1 hour)
12. **Add health checks back** → Now that deployment is stable, re-add proper health monitoring (1 hour)

**Total critical path:** ~3 hours for data safety, ~4 hours for stability, ~8-12 hours for next features
